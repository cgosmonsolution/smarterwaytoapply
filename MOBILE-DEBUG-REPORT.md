# Mobile Form Submission Debug & Fix Report

## Issues Fixed

### 1. **File Upload Processing Errors**
- **Problem**: Mobile Safari and other mobile browsers can fail when processing large files or have memory issues with FileReader
- **Fix**: Added comprehensive error handling to `fileToBase64()` function with:
  - File size validation (10MB limit)
  - Proper error catching and messaging
  - Progress logging for debugging

### 2. **Viewport Management Conflicts**
- **Problem**: Mobile viewport changes during form submission could conflict with input focus handling
- **Fix**: Added form submission state tracking:
  - `form-submitting` class prevents viewport changes during submission
  - Proper restoration of viewport after submission completes

### 3. **Touch Event Conflicts**
- **Problem**: Touch events for testimonial carousel could interfere with form interactions
- **Fix**: Made touch event listeners passive and added better conflict resolution

### 4. **Network Timeout Issues**
- **Problem**: Mobile connections can be slower/unreliable
- **Fix**: Added 30-second timeout with proper error handling and retry messaging

### 5. **Validation Improvements**
- **Problem**: Mobile users might miss validation errors
- **Fix**: 
  - Enhanced validation with better error messaging
  - Resume file requirement validation on final step
  - Mobile-specific scroll to error locations
