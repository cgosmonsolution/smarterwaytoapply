# Jess Recruiting Application - Technical Fix Summary

## Issue Resolved: MIME Type / JavaScript Loading Error

### Problem
The application was showing "Refused to execute script ... MIME type ('text/html') is not executable" errors because JavaScript files were being served with the wrong MIME type.

### Root Cause
The Azure Static Web Apps configuration (`staticwebapp.config.json`) had a catch-all route that was rewriting ALL requests (including JS files) to `/index.html`. This caused:
- `form-handler.js` → served as `index.html` (MIME: text/html)
- `mobile-optimizations.js` → served as `index.html` (MIME: text/html) 
- `enhanced.js` → served as `index.html` (MIME: text/html)

### Solution Applied

#### 1. Updated `staticwebapp.config.json`
- **Before**: Used catch-all route `"/*"` that rewrote everything to `/index.html`
- **After**: Used `navigationFallback` with exclusions for static assets

```json
{
  "routes": [
    {
      "route": "/*",
      "allowedRoles": ["anonymous"]
    }
  ],
  "navigationFallback": {
    "rewrite": "/index.html",
    "exclude": ["/api/*", "*.js", "*.css", "*.png", "*.jpg", "*.jpeg", "*.gif", "*.svg", "*.ico", "*.woff", "*.woff2", "*.json"]
  },
  "mimeTypes": {
    ".js": "application/javascript",
    ".css": "text/css",
    // ... other types
  }
}
```

#### 2. File Structure Confirmed
All JavaScript files are correctly placed in the root directory:
- ✅ `form-handler.js`
- ✅ `mobile-optimizations.js` 
- ✅ `enhanced.js`

#### 3. HTML References Verified
Script tags in `index.html` correctly reference root directory files:
```html
<script type="text/javascript" src="mobile-optimizations.js"></script>
<script type="text/javascript" src="form-handler.js"></script>
<script type="text/javascript" src="enhanced.js"></script>
```

### Key Configuration Changes

1. **navigationFallback**: Only rewrites to `index.html` for routes that don't match static file patterns
2. **exclusions**: Prevents JS, CSS, image files from being rewritten to `index.html`
3. **mimeTypes**: Explicitly defines correct MIME types for all static assets

### Expected Outcome
- ✅ JavaScript files will be served with `application/javascript` MIME type
- ✅ CSS files will be served with `text/css` MIME type  
- ✅ Images will be served with correct image MIME types
- ✅ SPA routing still works for non-asset URLs (falls back to `index.html`)
- ✅ All form functionality should now work correctly

### Testing
- All JavaScript files pass syntax validation (no errors)
- File structure and references are correct
- Configuration follows Azure Static Web Apps best practices

### Deployment Ready
The application is now ready for deployment to Azure Static Web Apps. The MIME type issue has been resolved and all static assets should load correctly.
